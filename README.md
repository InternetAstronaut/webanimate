## Building and Releasing the Desktop App 

Please refer to this Wiki entry for information on our dektop build processes! [https://github.com/Wicklets/wick-editor/wiki/Building-Desktop-Editors-for-Release](https://github.com/Wicklets/wick-editor/wiki/Building-Desktop-Editors-for-Release). (**NOTE: We don't actually build these, old electron is a finicky mess**).

If you are familiar with electron-builder, electron-packager, or have experience building desktop electron apps for production, we could use your help! Please message us or open an issue.
